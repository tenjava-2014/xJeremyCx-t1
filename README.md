Usage
-----

1. Install plugin. The name of this plugin is Weabomb.
About 2 hours left o_O so I only made 3 weapons, it's WarAxe, MultiShoots and EnderSticks. Each weapons have unique spells. WarAxe can rocket entityto sky when you hit an entity with it. MultiShoots can shoot 5 arrows at once. EnderSticks is a deadly weapon. It can hit entity 5 times and damage it by 5 health(or 2.5 hearts in Minecraft). There are 2 ways to obtain these weapons. One is by commands and another is by crafting. You can type /weabomb. You must be an op or have these permissions, warbomb.spawn.waraxe, warbomb.spawn.multishoots and warbomb.spawn.enderstick to spawn weapons. The crafting recipes are shown here. http://imgur.com/MInoEut.png.
